# IronPython Samples


This is a collection of smaples that demonstrate how to use IronPython in various enviornments.

All of them implement a very simple coin flipping game, the "business logic" of which is written in Python.

## FlippingGame

This is the core piece of Python code that implements the game logic and is used by all other samples.

## ConsoleSample

The console version of the game. There is a very small C# program that runs the game, which is written in Python.
This is about the simplest possible form of host.

## WinFormsSample

A more complex sample that uses the dynamic features of C# to call into the Python game code, with the UI and handlers
implemented entirely in C#. This is a more complex host that has to retrieve values from Python code.

## WpfSample

This is a WPF version of WinFormsSample, but it implements hosting in the same way.

## PyWpfSample

This is another WPF implementation of the game, but this time implemented entirely in Python. It uses the exact same XAML
as WpfSample.

There seems to be an issue running this smaple from PTVS, but running it from the command line (`ipyw PyWpfSample.py`) works.
